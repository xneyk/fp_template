 * PART 1 - LISTS AND PATTERN MATCHING
 * This part gives you some basic information about pattern matching.
 * For the exercises in this part you are _not_ allowed to use library functions,
 * you should implement recursive functions yourself using pattern matching.
 * It is worth 4 points.

   * Recursively sums all values in the list.

   * @return the sum of all values in xs.

    // Using `xs match` we "match" the value of the list.
    // This is called pattern matching.
    // For matching the whole list without any special conditions there are only two cases:
    //  Nil (or List()) and head :: tail, where head is one element and tail is a list.

  /**
   * N.B. Pay special attention to the following:
   * case matching can have a large number of cases; the FIRST one that
   * matches the argument mentioned before `match` is the one that will
   * `fire`. So if you have condition checks (guards, as they are called
   * in Scala) or a long list of cases to match against, beware of the order.
   *
   * Again:
   * 		!!!!! THE ORDER MATTERS IN CASE MATCHING !!!!!
   */

  /**
   * Scala also has immutable classes, called case classes. You can use
   * pattern matching on them as well.
   *
   * The following case classes are used for the next functions.
   * Note that `OptionalNum` itself cannot be instantiated (as it is abstract):
   *  it's either `None`, indicating no value, or `Num(i)`, indicating a value.
   *
   * The keyword `sealed` indicates that ONLY the two case classes below can
   * be an OptionalNum. This can be used as a safety mechanism when checking
   * pattern matching. With `sealed` forgetting a case in the pattern match
   * will result in the compiler producing a non-exhaustive matching warning
   * without the keyword, this will not happen.
   *
   * Scala has similar built-in classes:
   * `Option`, extended by `None()` and `Some(v)`.
   * This is a very useful one, since instead of `null` in Java (and the
   * Exceptions that come with it), when something is not found for example
   * you can just return None without throwing an exception.

/**
  * This part has some exercises for you to practice with the recursive lists and functions.
  * For the exercises in this part you are _not_ allowed to use library functions,
  * you should implement everything yourself.
  * Use recursion to process lists, iteration is not allowed.
  *
  * This part is worth 16 points.

    /**
     * Q13 (7p)
     * This question is a variant on a filter function. Given a List[A] and a
     * function f: A => Boolean, `myFilter` should retain all elements from
     * the list which satisfy 'f' and throw out all other elements. From the
     * resulting list, each element with an odd numbered index should also
     * be thrown out (we start counting the index at 0, of course).
     *
     * Take a look at the examples to see more directly what it needs to do
     * if you find this description vague.
     *
     * You are required to solve this using pattern matching on lists.
     * HINT: define a 'helper' method within myFilter which uses case matching.
     *
     * Examples:
     * 	val nrs = List.range(0,11) // List(0,1,2,3,...,10)
     * 	myFilter(nrs, (i: Int) => i % 2 == 0) // List(0,4,8)
     *
     * so although 2, 6 and 10 satisfy the function, they are thrown out.
